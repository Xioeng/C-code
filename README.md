# Little C and C++ code repository
This repository intends to show samples of C and C++ codes that are straightforward to use. Every file has its documentation written either in 
the preamble or comment printed when it is executed.

## Contents:
| Main File | Secondary files | Description |
|:--------:|:--------:|----------|
|poker_probability_calculator.c| | Computes the probabilities of each (5 or 7)-poker hand by using Monte Carlo's method using n samples. It implements cards as objects with two attributes: value and suit.|
|binary_tree.c | random_numbers.txt | Implements and computes a binary tree as a node recursive structure from an array that is read from a txt file (e.g. "random_numbers.txt"), it does and prints the (In, Pre, and Post) order walks.|
| graphs.cpp | graph_file_sample.txt | Implements min-heap and graph as classes with their basic operations. Also, it implements Dijkstra's, Prim's, and Kruskal's algorithms. Contains examples to verify the algorithms' functioning.|
